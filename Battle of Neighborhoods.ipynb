    "### Problem & Discussion\n",
    "Many people are forced to relocate for their careers and/or choose to move to a new city for better opportunities. However, most still have a home neighborhood they are fond of, or a favorite neighborhood from their hometown. This notebook will attempt to characterize the venues of a chosen neighborhood from one city and compare it to all neighborhoods of a different city, returning the neighborhood with the highest similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the personal use of this notebook, finding a neighborhood in a new city that is most similar to a favorite neighborhood back home, this workflow has business application as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say a company is looking to expand into a new city. By characterizing the area around an already high-performing location, and comparing that characterization against all neighborhoods in the new city, the business might be able to predict which new locations would be most likely to perform well. Similarly, by characterizing very low-performing locations and utilizing the same workflow, it might be possible to predict which neighborhoods should be avoided. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of Data & Execution\n",
    "For this project, I will select a neighborhood from Houston, TX and a list of all neighborhoods from Seattle, WA. These will be merged into a single DataFrame and analyzed using venue data from Foursquare. I will then run a clustering algorithm on the DataFrame and return the cluster that the Houston neighborhood belongs to. Finally, I will produce a map that depicts all neighborhoods in Seattle within the same cluster as the input neighborhood from Houston.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighborhood names for Houston and Seattle will be obtained from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Houston_neighborhoods and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_Seattle, respectively. Location data for each neighborhood will be gathered by iteratively feeding each neighborhood name into the geocoder tool. Once neighborhood locations are defined, each lat-long point can be queried in Foursquare for venue information, one-hot encoded, and clustered.\n",
